## Development

Sass/SCSS is a CSS preprocessor that has kinds of sweet sugar - nesting styles, variables, importing files, mixins and more. [Install the command line tools](http://sass-lang.com/install) for your platform, then from this directory, execute:

```bash
sass --watch sass:stylesheets
```
