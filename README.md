hackmit-splash
==============
This is the HackMIT Splash Page.

This is deployed using Amazon CodeDeploy - meaning anything deployed on `master` will be public facing.

This means you have to follow the number one rule:

1. Never commit to `master`, only merge in `develop`.

We'll do most or all of our work in develop.

That is all :)
